# Drowsiness Detection System
## Overview
  This repository contains the code for a drowsiness detection system based on computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system is designed to monitor the eye state of a driver in     real-time and issue an alert when signs of drowsiness are detected.
## Key Features
### Multiple Pretrained Models: 
The system utilizes a range of pretrained models, including DenseNet, InceptionV3, and VGG16, for drowsiness classification.
